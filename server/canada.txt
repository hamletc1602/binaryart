Enigmatic moon casting deep shadows upon weary earth from the vault of a million worlds
Dappled pebble beach bathed in silver light, encircling mysterious depths
Crisp night air slipping over my skin
I am at this midnight shore to meet a friend

As I sit upon my driftwood throne
Luminous amber spheres gaze from between pine sentries
And move on
Owl’s perpetual question drifts among the trees
Ruffling the expectant stillness
So begins the night’s melodious choir
Howls swelling in joyous salute

Charmed by nature’s soothing lullaby
My leaden eyelids start to fall earthward
On the glistening vista stretched before me
A momentary ripple of obsidian water
Harbinger of a late arrival
At last my stalwart friend is here
His bulky rudder and stout frame
As graceful in the water as any lofty eagle soaring
